# Vue Instagram Feed - WORK IN PROGRESS

## Heads up!
This package is written in ES6 and exported as an ES module. You can import it natively in all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge) or through a bundler like Webpack.
To make it work for IE11, you need to transpile the code to ES5 and add a polyfill for the Fetch API


## Setup

1. Install the component

``` bash
# npm
npm i vue-instagram-feed
```

``` bash
# yarn
yarn add vue-instagram-feed
```

2. Import the component
